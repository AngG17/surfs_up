## Summary

The air temperature is favorable in both June and December to conclude that a surf and ice cream shop business in Oahu would be sustainable all year.  It would be helpful to look at precipitation totals during the same time frames to see if a wet season could impact the number of days a person would likely surf.  It would also be helpful to look at the number of times the temperature was below 60 degrees in any given year in December.  If it is just a couple days each year, then that shouldn't play a huge factor in sustainability.  Are the wet days the same days as the cold days?  That could be another query to look at.
